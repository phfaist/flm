title: 'Kitaev surface code (test)'
---

Introduced in Refs.~\cite{doi:10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155,doi:10.1007/978-1-4615-5923-8_19,arXiv:quant-ph/9707021}

A family of abelian topological CSS stabilizer codes whose generators are
few-body \(X\)-type and \(Z\)-type Pauli strings associated to the stars and
plaquettes, respectively, of a cellulation of a two-dimensional surface (with a
qubit located at each edge of the cellulation).  \textit{Toric code} often
either refers to the construction on the two-dimensional torus or is an
alternative name for the general construction.  The construction on surfaces
with boundaries is often called the \textit{planar code}
\cite{arXiv:quant-ph/9810055,arXiv:quant-ph/9811052,arXiv:1606.07116}.
Codewords correspond to ground states of the surface code Hamiltonian, and error
operators create or annihilate pairs of anyonic charges or vortices.

An encoder: A depth-\(L^2\) circuit that grows the code out of a small patch on an \(L\times L\) square lattice using CNOT gates (i.e., "local moves") \cite{arxiv:quant-ph/0110143,arxiv:0712.0348}.
